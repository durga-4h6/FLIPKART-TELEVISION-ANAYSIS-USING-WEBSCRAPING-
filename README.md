# FLIPKART-TELEVISION-ANAYSIS-USING-WEBSCRAPING-
**ABOUT THE PROJECT**
This project focuses on analyzing television products listed on Flipkart by collecting real-world data through web scraping and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to understand pricing trends, brand dominance, feature preferences, and customer satisfaction in the Indian television market.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Television product data on e-commerce platforms like Flipkart is large, unstructured, and difficult to analyze manually. Customers struggle to compare TVs across brands, while businesses lack clear insights into market trends, pricing strategies, and consumer preferences.

**OBJECTIVES**

To scrape television product data from Flipkart
To analyze brand-wise pricing and availability
To study the relationship between price, screen size, features, and ratings
To identify popular brands and dominant price segments
To support data-driven decision-making for customers and businesses

**DATA SOURCE**

Flipkart (Publicly available television product listing pages)

**TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES
Python
Requests
BeautifulSoup
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
CSV / Excel

**WEB SCRAPING APPROACH**

Used browser developer tools to inspect HTML structure
Identified relevant HTML tags, classes, and IDs
Sent HTTP requests using the Requests library
Extracted product details using BeautifulSoup
Scraped multiple pages to collect a comprehensive dataset

**DATA CLEANING STEPS**

Removed duplicate and missing records
Cleaned price values by removing currency symbols and commas
Converted price columns to numeric format
Converted ratings into float values
Standardized product names and specifications
Filtered out incomplete and irrelevant records

**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)**

Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
Analyzed brand distribution using bar charts
Studied price distribution using histograms
Detected outliers using box plots
Examined relationships between price, screen size, and ratings
Used heatmaps to visualize correlations

**KEY INSIGHTS**

Samsung, LG, and Sony dominate the Flipkart television market
Most televisions fall within the budget and mid-range price categories
Television prices increase mainly with screen size and technology
Customer ratings remain consistent across price ranges
Higher-priced televisions do not necessarily receive higher ratings

**CONCLUSION**

The Flipkart television market is highly competitive and driven more by features and brand positioning than customer ratings. Mid-range televisions dominate the market, and customer satisfaction remains stable across different price segments. Buyers should focus on specifications rather than price or discounts alone.
